# Hospital Bed Finder

Hospital Bed Finder (HBF, for short) is a commissioned project.
This project mainly serves as a proof of concept into a hospital
bed monitoring project in a larger scale. The project generally
follows the MVC architecture. For the frontend, the project uses
plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript. For the backend it uses Express.js (Node.js)
with EJS as its templating engine.

By the date of writing of this README, the development of this
project has completely stopped, but I might return to this project
to add improvements or to utilize an existing project for learning
new languages or frameworks.

## Who uses Hospital Bed Finder

As this project has ultimately served its purpose of being a proof of
concept, it is no longer being hosted (previously on an AWS EC2 instance)
and has no active users.

## How to get started with the project

1. Clone the repository and install all its dependencies via npm (execute `npm install` from home directory)
2. Deploy the database (MongoDB) that the project uses via `docker compose up -d`
3. Run the server via the command `npm run dev`
